# Computer Organization and Assembly Language Assignments README

Welcome to the Computer Organization and Assembly Language assignments folder! Here, you'll find a collection of projects completed during my course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, focusing on fundamental concepts of computer organization and low-level programming. These projects are written in either C or Assembly language, providing hands-on experience with various programming paradigms.

## Project Overview

### Basic Functions Assignment
This project introduces basic function implementation in C, teaching how to take in arguments and calculate values or return different values based on the provided arguments. It serves as a foundational exercise for understanding function structures and parameter passing mechanisms.

### Selection Sort
The Selection Sort project involves implementing the Selection Sort algorithm in C. This sorting technique is essential for understanding sorting algorithms and their efficiency. The project provides hands-on experience with array manipulation and algorithmic complexity analysis.

### Prime Number Generator
Another project in this repository is a program that takes in a value and generates all prime numbers less than or equal to the given number. This project explores concepts of number theory and algorithmic efficiency, requiring optimization techniques for prime number generation.

### Assembly Language Calculation Functions
The final project in this folder involves implementing basic calculation functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and storing values in memory slots using Assembly language. This project offers insight into low-level programming concepts and processor architecture.

## Running the Projects

To run these projects, you can use the UAB-owned Vulcan server or WSL with Ubuntu:
- **Vulcan Server (UAB):** Access the Vulcan server provided by UAB to compile and run the code. Ensure you have appropriate access credentials to log in to the server.
- **WSL with Ubuntu:** Alternatively, you can set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu on your local machine to run these projects. Follow the instructions provided within each project's README for compilation and execution.

## Contributing

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contribute! Your feedback is valuable in enhancing the quality and usability of the projects.
