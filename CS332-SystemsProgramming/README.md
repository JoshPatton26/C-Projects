# Systems Programming Projects Repository

Welcome to my Systems Programming projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of diverse projects completed during my CS332 Systems Programming course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. Each project is crafted in C and showcases a variety of programming skills and concepts.

## Project Highlights

### CSV Data Parsing and Filtering
One of the projects involves parsing and filtering through data in CSV files. This task requires efficient data manipulation techniques to extract and process information from structured files.

### Directory Listing and System Calls
Another project focuses on reading a specified directory and recursively listing out all the child folders/files contained within. Additionally, this project extends its functionality by integrating system calls into the recursive listing process, enhancing the understanding of system-level operations.

### Miscellaneous Assignments
Smaller assignments included in this repository cover a wide range of topics, such as:
- Prime number checker
- Insertion sort algorithm implementation
- File I/O operations for reading from one file and writing data to another
- Execution of Unix commands read from a file
- Understanding parent and child processes through fork-exec-wait methods
- I/O redirection for input/output stream manipulation
- Multithreaded processing to perform array element summation

## Environment and Setup
I primarily developed these projects using the Vulcan server for compilation and execution. However, for those without access to Vulcan, the code is compatible with WSL running Ubuntu. My preferred IDE for code editing is Visual Studio Code, offering a user-friendly interface for project management and syntax highlighting. Although I use MSYS2 MinGW 64x as my compiler, I have encountered limitations in compiling and running code directly through VSCode, thus restricting its usage to code editing purposes.

## Contributing
If you discover any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please feel free to contribute! I welcome feedback and collaboration to improve the quality of the projects.
