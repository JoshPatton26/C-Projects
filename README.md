# C Projects Repository

Welcome to my C projects repository! This repository houses projects completed during my studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The projects are primarily divided into two folders:

1. **Computer Organization and Assembly Language Assignments:** This folder contains assignments related to computer organization and assembly language programming. These assignments focus on fundamental concepts of computer architecture and low-level programming.

2. **Systems Programming Assignments:** The second folder comprises assignments from the Systems Programming course. These assignments delve into topics such as system calls, file I/O, process management, and interprocess communication.

## Running the Projects

### Using Vulcan Server (UAB)

To run these projects, you can utilize the Vulcan server provided by UAB. You will need appropriate access credentials to log in to the server. Once logged in, navigate to the respective project folder and compile/run the source files using the provided compiler (e.g., gcc). Detailed instructions for compiling and running each project can be found within their respective directories.

### Using WSL with Ubuntu

Alternatively, you can set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu on your local machine to run these projects. Ensure that you have WSL installed and configured properly. Once set up, follow these steps:

1. Open WSL terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project you want to run.
2. Compile the source files using the gcc compiler. You might need to install gcc if it's not already installed (`sudo apt install gcc`).
3. Run the compiled executable as per the instructions provided in the project's README or within the source files.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the projects or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
